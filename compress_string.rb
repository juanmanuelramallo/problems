# Compress string

# The input is a string of chars e.g. "aabbcccdeeef"
# Your goal is to write three compression algorithms given the following rules:
# 1. In place:                            "ddabbbccaaaad" -> "d2a1b3c2a4d1"
# 2. Grouped:                             "ddabbbccaaaad" -> "d3a5b3c2"
# 3. Grouped and ordered alphabetically:  "ddabbbccaaaad" -> "a5b3c2d3"
